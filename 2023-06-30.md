Defcon 516 is a subset (subsidiary? affiliate? associate? subgroup?) of DEF CON.  Defcon 516 identifies with the geographic boundaries (historyical and/or overlays) of the  516, 631, 363, and 934 area codes.<sup>2</sup>

(<sup>2</sup> Nassau and Suffolk Counties, New York State)

DC516 is independent of other DEF CON Groups in that DC516's agenda is its own -- any resemblance or similarities to other DC groups (ex.: DC212, DC201, etc.) is purely coincidental.

There is no commercial purpose to DC516.

(Note: All costs incurred thus far have and will be paid for out-of-pocket by xio/0xF09F8687 until further notice (including, but not limited to, website hosting, and videoconferencing subscription[s].)

DC516 provides an open forum for participants.
